# BachelorThesis
My bachelor thesis, an introduction to quantum computing (in italian).
It gives some introductory notions about Quantum Mechanics and about
complexity theory.
After having given a short description of the inner working of a quantum
computer it describes a few important routines in quantum computing,
with the aim of understanding Shor's algorithm for integer factoring.
